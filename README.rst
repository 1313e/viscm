==========

Compute perceptual similarity between sRGB colors according to the
CAM02-UCS formula given by:

Luo, M. R., Cui, G., & Li, C. (2006). Uniform colour spaces based on
CIECAM02 colour appearance model. Color Research & Application, 31(4),
320â€“330. doi:10.1002/col.20227

We can also calculate the "large color difference" (LCD) and "short
color difference" (SCD) metrics estimated by the same publication. The
UCS ("uniform color space") metric is defined as a compromise between
these two.

We also have a complete CIECAM02 implementation. Maybe that should get
higher billing.

todo: XYZ1 vs XYZ100? ditto for sRGB1 vs sRGB256?
+ tons of search replace for all the variable names

similarly fix naming for J'a'b' or JKapbp or whatever

add colorblindness simulation
add CIELCh, J'a'b'?

clean up viscm
